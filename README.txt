The idea of our website is to connect students with tutors through an easy to use online interface where users can sign up as either a student seeking help or a tutoring offering help.

Features:
 - The website will allow students to connect to tutors.
 - Students will be able to narrow tutors down to meet their personal needs.
 - Tutors will be able to specify what topics they offer help in as well as available schedule times.
